I'm Jesús, i'm a software developer living in the sunny barcelona. I really like do
excercise I have been swimming for almost 2 year (and yet i still suck on it :D) most
recently i have been doing crossfit, i love it.




In this blog i want to talk about all my hobbies, dreams, goals, etc. So you could
find the must geek article and the next one could be some surf article or cook article.

This is my life, i hope you enjoy it.
